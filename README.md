## 📖 Origin Story

This project started as a class assignment for **ITIS 3135 (Web-Based Application Design and Development)** at UNC Charlotte. The original version was a simple static HTML/CSS/JS site hosted on GitHub Pages, built to promote sustainable fashion awareness for our client, Holly Needham, at UNC Greensboro.

**🔗 Original class project:** [webpages.charlotte.edu/jlutabin/assets/itis3135/project/](https://webpages.charlotte.edu/jlutabin/assets/itis3135/project/)

What started as a 10-page static site with hardcoded content and no backend has evolved into a full-stack cloud application with user authentication, a serverless API, a real database, and a modern React frontend — deployed on AWS infrastructure that can scale to thousands of users.

### Then vs Now

| Feature | Original (Class Project) | Current (AWS Platform) |
|---------|------------------------|----------------------|
| **Hosting** | GitHub Pages (static) | AWS Amplify + S3 + CloudFront |
| **Frontend** | Raw HTML/CSS/JS with `data-include` for components | Next.js 15 + React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS v4 |
| **Backend** | None — forms showed an `alert()` and discarded data | API Gateway + Lambda + DynamoDB |
| **Database** | None — all content hardcoded in HTML | DynamoDB (Submissions + Users tables) |
| **Authentication** | None | AWS Cognito (email signup, verification, JWT tokens) |
| **Deployment** | Manual file upload | Git push → auto-deploy via Amplify |
| **Design** | Basic CSS with centered layout | Custom design system with Playfair Display + DM Sans, animations, card layouts, grain texture |
| **Search** | Basic client-side `input` filtering | Maintained + improved with modern UI |
| **Images** | Static `<img>` tags | Next.js `<Image>` with optimization and lazy loading |
| **Security** | None | JWT-secured API, IAM roles, CORS, billing alerts |
| **Scalability** | Single static host | Serverless — handles 50 to 50,000 users without code changes |
| **Cost** | Free (GitHub Pages) | ~$5-15/mo (serverless, scales to zero) |

The original project used `HTML.Include.min.js` to inject a shared header and footer into each page — essentially a hand-rolled component system. The new version uses proper React components, server-side rendering, and a real routing system. Every piece of hardcoded content now has a path to becoming dynamic and database-driven.

## 🚀 Getting Started
 
### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+

- Git
 
### Local Development
 
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jtlutabingwa/concious-closet-2.0.git
cd concious-closet-2.0

npm install
 
# Run development server
npm run dev
```
 
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
 
> **Note:** The frontend runs locally at localhost:3000 with full navigation and page rendering. Form submissions and user authentication require the AWS backend services (API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, Cognito), which are configured separately and not included in this repo.

## 💰 Cost Estimate

All services are serverless and scale to zero when idle.

| User Scale | Monthly Cost | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| 50 users | ~$5 | Mostly free tier |
| 500 users | ~$16 | Past free tier on some services |
| 5,000 users | ~$32 | Full serverless pricing |
| 50,000 users | ~$134 | Still cheaper than a single EC2 + RDS setup |
